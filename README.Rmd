# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
	
This is the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data.
The main R script (`run_analysis.R`) does the following and 
can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory:

1. Loads the activity and feature info
2. Loads the training and test datasets, keeping only the columns containing
   the mean or standard deviation
3. Loads and merges the activity and subject data for each dataset
4. Merges the two data
5. Converts columns into factors
6. Creates a tidy dataset consisting of the mean value for each variable, subject 
   and activity pair.
7. The tidy dataset is written out to the file: `tidy.txt`.
